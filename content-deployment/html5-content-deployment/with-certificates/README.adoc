# Generic Application Content Deployment With Service Key With XSUAA managed certificates

The Deployment Service is capable of deploying content to services using a service key that has a 'certificate', 'key' and 'clientId'. This way the Deployment Service does not use the standard token exchange with 'clientId' and 'clientSecret' but uses the provided certificate (mTLS).

# Try it out
In the current directory execute `cf deploy`. This will automatically assemble the MTA archive and deploy it:

```bash
$ cf deploy
Deploying multi-target app archive */with-certificates/ui5MTA.mtar in org ******** / space ******** as ********...

Uploading 1 files...
  */with-certificates/ui5MTA.mtar
