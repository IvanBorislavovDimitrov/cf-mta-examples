# Partial deployment

Partial deployment is a feature allowing fine control over which parts of the MTA are getting processed by the MTA Deployment service and which not.
One is able to select only certain module(s) and/or resource(s) for deployment. The MTA Deployment service takes care to orchestrate the deployment only for the selected parts and skips the rest.

WARNING: All descriptor validations and dependency cheks on the processed modules are always executed. If the MTA archive is invalid or e.g. an module has a missing dependency (i.e. service instance which should be bound to but does not exist), deployment fails. 

## Usage
To use feature, pass one of the following environment variablest to the `cf deploy` or `cf bg-deploy commands`

|===
|-m <module name>|
Deploy only the module with the specified name.
Note: It can be used multiple times.
|--all-modules|
Deploy all modules.
|-r <resource name>|
Deploy only the resource with the specified name
Note:It can be used multiple times.
|--all-resources|
Deploy all resources.ÃŸ

## Partial build & assembly
Only selected moduels would be built and included in the MTA archive. This optimizes built & assembly time, the archive size and respectfully upload & processing time in the MTA deployment service. 

### Partial build
Partial build procedure is under construction...

### Partial assembly
If staring from mtad.yaml, the cf deploy command is capable of assembling an MTA archive just before deployment. The list of modules passed to the (bg-)deploy command is used to select which would be included in the assembled archive.

NOTE: the modules `path` argument has to be maintained for assembly to work. All selected modules should have such pointing to properly build module bits.

## Partial deploy

In the current directory you'll find example cf app payload with the following structure:

* development descriptor: link:mta.yaml[mta.yaml]
* deployment descriptor: link:mtad.yaml[mtad.yaml]

# Try out

## Deploy directly from directory, via mtad.yaml 
In the current directory, run `cf deploy -m module-b -r service-2`. This will automatically assemble an MTA archive and deploy it 
```bash
$ cf deploy -m module-b -r service-2
Deploying multi-target app archive */mta-examples/hello-world.mtar in org ******** / space ******** as **** ...
Uploading 1 files...
  */mta-examples/hello-world.mtar
OK

```
## Assemble MTA archive via mtad.yaml and deploy
First use `mbt assemble` to create the *.mtar and than deploy it with `cf deploy`.

NOTE: This approach is less efficient, as all modules are included in the MTA archive and uploaded to the MTA deployment service. Regardless that only the selected ones are processed. 
```bash
$$ mbt assemble

## Build MTA archive via mta.yaml and deploy

## Dependency validations

WARNING: When selecting an MTA module/resource for processing, make sure it's dependencies are also selected or are already existing.
 
E.g. If in a clean environment, only a module is selected, without the services it depends on - deployment would fail

```bash
$ cf undeploy hello-world --delete-services -f
... 
Process finished.

$ cf mtas
Getting multi-target apps in org ******** / space ******** as ********...
OK
mta id           version   

$ cf deploy ./ -m module-b
Creating application "module-b" from MTA module "module-b"...
Error creating or updating application "module-b": Could not bind application "module-b" to service "service-2": 404 Not Found: Service service-2 not found. 

$ cf deploy ./ -r service-2 -f

...
Process finished.

$ cf deploy ./ -m module-b
...
Application "module-b" started and available at "******-*-module-b.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
...

```
HINT: If you expect tu redeploy MTA modules/resources multiple times e.g. when doing minor adjustments to them - it may make sense to do a full deployment once and later only update the modules/resources you want.
